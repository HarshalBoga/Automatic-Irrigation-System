# Automatic Irrigation System.

The consumption of water increases day by day that may lead to the problem of water scarcity. The aim of the project was to develop a smart irrigation system which measures the moisture of the soil and turns on or off the water supply system.

## Tech Stack
1. Arduino Uno 
2. Moisture Sensor
3. Autodesk Tinkercad for simulation


## Working

In this project, we are building an IoT based smart irrigation System using Arduino UNO, Moisture sensor, and LCD Display. It will automatically sprinkle the water to plants when the moisture value goes below a particular value. It will also send the moisture data to LCD display to keep track of the land condition. LCD Display will display whether Water Pump is on or off. This project uses a solenoid valve to supply the water to the plants. You can change the moisture value at which the solenoid valve should turn on according to your plant's requirement. Here we are using Arduino UNO which is a very popular for IoT based Projects.
